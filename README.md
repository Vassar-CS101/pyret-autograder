# Gradescope Pyret Autograding

To prepare the autograder for use with Gradescope: 

1. Create/find the respective assignment branch in the [`pyret-assignments` repository](https://github.com/brown-cs111/pyret-assignments).
2. Place wheats, chaffs, tests, and stencil files in their respective directories.
3. Update `points.json` to match the wheats, chaffs, and tests.
4. Zip the contents of the branch and upload to Gradescope.
