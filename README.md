# Gradescope Pyret Autograding

The `result-processing` project handles converting from pyret's output to the
format gradescope expects. 

To prepare the autograder on gradescope, place wheats, chaffs, tests, and
stencil files in their respective directories, and zip the contents of the
respective assignment branch in the `pyret-assignments` repo.
